len ,"(Optional) The length of the event in frames, if localizations from consecutive frames have been linked.",long 
n ,"(Optional) The number of localizations in this event, if localizations from consecutive frames have been linked, potentially diverging from the “len” column due to a transient dark time tolerance.",long
